    "The 2 identities given above identify the hockey stick pattern of Pascal's Triangle. What it means is, is that starting from any 1 on the side of the triangle, if the numbers to the bottom towards the center of the triangle are added up, it will equal whatever number is next down but to the outside of the triangle. This occurs from both the right and left of the triangle due to its symmetry."
